# Senate Vote Comparitor

### ProPublica Congress API

I built this comparitor through a desire to compare senators' voting records head-to-head. The app uses React and asynchronus requests to the ProPublica Congress API to quickly display voting results of any two senators head-to-head. Dropdown boxes allow for choosing congress year, vote number, and senators. Each senators party and vote result are provided after completing necessary fields.
