# Senate Vote Comparator

### ProPublica Congress API

I built this comparator through a desire to see senators' voting records head-to-head. The app uses React and asynchronous requests to the ProPublica Congress API to quickly display voting results of any two senators side-by-side. Dropdown boxes allow for choosing congress year, vote number, and senators. Each senators' party, state, and vote result are provided after completing necessary fields.
